0
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:04,000
Previously on Love Island All-Stars...

1
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,240
There were departures...

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,000
Jo and Joanna.

3
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,000
And a new arrival made his move.

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,820
The girl that I would like to steal is Arabella.

5
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,900
Chris, you are now single and have therefore been dumped from the villa.

6
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,000
Please pack your bags and say goodbyes.

7
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,580
Tonight, one boy's having doubts.

8
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,300
I just don't feel like I found that spark.

9
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:48,340
Casey is basically now saying he doesn't know if him and Eve could work in the outside.

10
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:49,880
What?

11
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,660
And the power is in your hands.

12
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,420
Islanders, the public have been voting for their favourite couple.

13
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,960
The couples with the fewest votes are at risk of being dumped

14
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,060
from the island tonight.

15
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:04,880
Tonight.

16
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,320
Bombshell Adam is in the villa.

17
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,720
I wanted to ask him how he got his wrestling nickname, Flex,

18
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,760
but he was too busy biting his toenails.

19
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,320
Now, Adam's stolen Arabella, meaning Chris has been dumped.

20
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,620
Oh, my God.

21
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,100
Wow.

22
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,440
I haven't seen eye to eye, but, honestly, you're amazing.

23
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,660
Thank you.

24
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,100
Hey, Mum.

25
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,800
I feel like I've taken one of the biggest energies

26
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,120
from the villa, though, do you know what I mean?

27
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,460
I breathe slow, let go, then give it to the water.

28
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,800
Give it to the war, darlin'

29
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,560
I'll see you in a minute.

30
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,280
He's going to be missed by us all, for sure.

31
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,160
Top bloke, and I can't wait to see him on the outside, to be honest.

32
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,120
Sad boys.

33
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,180
Thanks for being here with me, though.

34
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,400
Oh, man.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,440
Chris has been there from day dot with me,

36
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,880
like, always been someone I could talk to.

37
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,900
You're going to be a miss, brother.

38
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,100
Thanks, mate.

39
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,420
It's been an absolute ride, boys.

40
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,780
Ups and downs, highs and lows.

41
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,340
I've enjoyed every waking second with you all.

42
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,580
I love you all, deeply.

43
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,100
See you on the outside.

44
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,370
See you later, Chris.

45
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,360
See you, guys.

46
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:03,570
Thank you, guys.

47
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,520
Hello, Chris.

48
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,520
Hello, babe.

49
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,320
How are you doing?

50
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,520
Oh, I'm furious.

51
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,300
You're fuming?

52
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:28,980
Yeah.

53
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:29,740
Really?

54
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,820
Yeah, look at my face.

55
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,260
I'm furious.

56
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,140
Do you look happy?

57
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,280
I'm quite happy.

58
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,640
Yeah?

59
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,600
How was that experience?

60
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,560
Did you expect to get dumped like that?

61
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,560
Actually, no.

62
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,460
I didn't expect it.

63
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,720
Your fellow Islanders, they did look really sad to see you leave, especially Georgia and

64
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,160
Toby.

65
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,280
Yeah, they had a little cry.

66
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,800
You obviously got quite close with those guys in there.

67
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:49,540
Yeah, I was really close, really close with Toby from the beginning, really.

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,260
And G's always been like my little sister anyway.

69
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,160
I knew her before.

70
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,940
Like, we've always had that vibe.

71
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,020
Well, let's talk about your journey now, Chris, because you coupled up with Arabella.

72
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,960
And you know, at one point, it looked like you could be a perfect match.

73
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,320
You had a date together on the rowing boat, everything was all lovey-lovey, and then...

74
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,220
I'd literally been so vulnerable with her on the date,

75
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,320
and then I just felt like it had been thrown straight back in my face later that night.

76
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,330
And Joanna came in.

77
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,060
I would say swooped you off your feet, but it wasn't that smooth, was it?

78
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,560
Joanna walked in.

79
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,330
I fancied Joanna for a good while.

80
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,330
How long did you fancy Joanna for beforehand?

81
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,660
A good four years.

82
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,060
What?

83
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,320
So, yeah, when she walked in, I was quite excited.

84
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,930
It was quite weird in, like, the group scenario at the beginning.

85
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,400
Like, she was talking to everyone, but only really looking at me.

86
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,600
Like, the eye contact was pretty mad.

87
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,040
But then, obviously, the game happened.

88
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,360
It got left at a really awkward point,

89
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,810
when we were, like, smack bang in the middle of figuring it out

90
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,000
and what it could have been and all that kind of stuff.

91
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,620
So, like, yeah, left with questions.

92
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,920
And now your Love Island journey's over.

93
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,700
Do you hope to make things work with Joanna on the outside now?

94
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,860
Well, we definitely need a conversation.

95
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,970
Cos I really enjoy getting to know her.

96
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,970
We were quite early on, but the amount of people in there

97
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,960
that were saying, like, you two are, like, the same person,

98
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,300
like, you've got the same energy.

99
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,560
Unfortunately, they're the same people

100
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,960
that voted as most incompatible.

101
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:07,760
Right.

102
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,480
Which is quite hilarious when you think about it.

103
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,680
But, yeah, I'm definitely gonna have a chat.

104
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,120
Yeah, where there's love, there's hope

105
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,800
in all those things they say, isn't there?

106
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,200
Chris, it has been an absolute pleasure watching you.

107
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,160
All the way from the beginning, you've made us laugh,

108
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,650
and I feel like we've definitely got to know you

109
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,640
a bit better this time.

110
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,120
Yeah.

111
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,960
Yeah, all right, well, thank you so much.

112
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,020
Look after yourself.

113
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,320
Thank you.

114
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,300
Ooh, you smell delicious.

115
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:33,490
Back in the villa, Toby and Georgia S are finding Chris's departure tough to take.

116
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,650
He's the other one that booted for us, do you know what I mean?

117
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,130
No.

118
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:39,730
We got each other.

119
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:40,970
Yeah.

120
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:42,650
Do you want me to come over or not?

121
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,250
Yeah, come over as well.

122
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:45,770
Get me.

123
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:47,810
I'm glad you're behind us.

124
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,050
You can go and chat to Joanna, innit?

125
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:55,690
I feel like that's the...

126
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,990
I feel like that's, like, a comforting...

127
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,060
I think that's something that could continue in the outside world.

128
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,700
I feel like I'm in shock.

129
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,960
It's another one where, like, you're fighting back the tears.

130
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,760
It's just so hard.

131
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,400
Arabella's fallen for wrestler Adam.

132
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,660
Be careful, mate.

133
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,520
Normally, when that happens,

134
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,080
Adam pins you to the floor and counts to three.

135
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:16,940
Adam...

136
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,800
Where is it?

137
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:24,280
I feel like you'd get more of a serious, deeper side as well.

138
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,960
Like, you'll be able to talk to him.

139
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,560
Sexy, yeah.

140
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,600
He wrestles as well.

141
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,480
So sexy.

142
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,180
He seems like a good lad, though.

143
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,120
He seems really...

144
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,760
She's smitten already.

145
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,580
She's like a cat with nine lives.

146
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,360
She just keeps coming back!

147
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,260
You know he's a wrestler?

148
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,640
He can wrestle me around!

149
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,600
LAUGHTER

150
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,640
Any day.

151
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,120
Let's go talk about it.

152
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:45,840
LAUGHTER

153
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,340
Oh!

154
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,300
Yeah, smooth.

155
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,160
That was...

156
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,120
That was a smooth transition, that.

157
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:51,960
LAUGHTER

158
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,600
Honestly, this is the happiest I've been and felt

159
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,400
since the second I walked in this villa.

160
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,880
I feel like my journey in here now makes sense.

161
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,920
I'm happy you picked me.

162
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,040
I was going to ask you about that.

163
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,080
Yeah, I'm very, very happy.

164
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,680
I'm not going to lie, I was hoping when you walked in,

165
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,380
I was like, hmm, I hope he picks me.

166
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,360
Was the speech all right?

167
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,120
It was, it was.

168
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,000
I feel like you like hit the nail on the head.

169
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,540
I think you're just like a really flirty person.

170
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,420
Oh, I am?

171
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,760
I think you just flirt with everyone.

172
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,380
No, I don't flirt.

173
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,280
Maybe you don't even realise you are.

174
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,240
Is this how you are?

175
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:20,980
You just have good energy?

176
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:21,590
Yeah.

177
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,580
I'm a flirty person, but I think if I'm into someone there's certain ways I do respect

178
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,760
You've got to have boundaries as well

179
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,760
Oh, 100%

180
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,280
Because I'm like, like I said, I'm at a stage now where I'm ready to meet someone and actually

181
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,040
have something serious

182
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,420
Yeah

183
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,160
I've made mistakes before and now I know what I want to, I mean, but

184
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,800
I think life is about making mistakes, I think, like, I've made a lot of mistakes in my life

185
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,600
and I feel like if you don't make mistakes, like, you don't have anything to go by of

186
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,020
like what's right, what's wrong

187
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,100
Every mistake is a lesson

188
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:46,960
Yeah, exactly

189
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,080
Like, what is, like, a good, like, first date?

190
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,320
What would you, like...

191
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,920
Are you a dinner person and drinks?

192
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,720
No, it depends, obviously, where we are.

193
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,540
On a...

194
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,580
Well, where we are or where the person and me is.

195
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,700
Is this a date?

196
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,420
It could be a date.

197
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,640
I give this cheers to first date.

198
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,340
First date.

199
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,480
You have to look into my eyes.

200
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,980
Oh, you get seven years bad sex?

201
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,500
Look into my eye.

202
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,800
I'll never have seven years.

203
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,720
You can't get bad sex with me.

204
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,220
Wow, we're on the same...

205
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,740
I feel like you've damned me in here for a reason, for sure.

206
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,280
This is kind of going too well.

207
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,700
I know, I'm slightly scared.

208
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,360
I haven't been in a situation like that in a while now,

209
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,940
where I've got a very attractive woman in front of me

210
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,620
and I'm chatting to them, and it just felt effortless.

211
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,380
Like, the conversation flowed, there was no awkward silences.

212
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,440
I just feel like the more we have these conversations,

213
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,080
we'll learn more and more about each other.

214
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,560
Yeah, I'm excited about that, jeez.

215
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,660
So, Chris is gone.

216
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,640
I enjoyed Maya's interview earlier,

217
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,920
although she did forget the million dollar question.

218
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,240
I mean, what is Chris's favourite farmyard animal?

219
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,140
Right, all-stars, off to bed.

220
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,100
Happier than you were with Joe?

221
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:53,940
Very.

222
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:54,920
Really?

223
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,040
You excited, Arabella?

224
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:56,910
SHE LAUGHS

225
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:10,400
Oh, the best day, and a bittersweet night.

226
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:23,730
Night!

227
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:24,730
Night guys

228
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:41,500
Someday I want a love like the love I had with you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh.

229
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,560
It's morning and wrestler Adam suddenly realised that the last time he was

230
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,040
surrounded by 11 people flat on their backs,

231
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,000
he just won the All-Ireland Battle Royale Championships.

232
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,160
MUSIC

233
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,000
Morning, everyone.

234
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,560
Morning, Robert.

235
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,340
How was your first sleep in bed with Arabella?

236
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,700
We had a nice cuddle.

237
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:15,960
Did you?

238
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,360
Yeah, it was nice.

239
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,400
It is weird without Chris's voice in the morning, isn't it?

240
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,220
These two were locking lips, and all I had was like this.

241
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,360
Yeah, a kissing corner over there.

242
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,480
Coffee time, then.

243
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,020
I feel small in his arms.

244
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,120
How is that possible?

245
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,680
A nice surprise in addition, for sure.

246
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,780
Do you put milk in?

247
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,380
Yeah.

248
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,500
You have to with Eggy Rose.

249
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,880
Did you kiss him?

250
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:53,460
No.

251
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,080
I never knew you kissed Joe.

252
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,800
Now Bella does not waste any time.

253
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,050
Time is of the essence, guys.

254
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:58,840
Psych scoffer.

255
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,180
Don't give it to Jack.

256
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,020
The kissy-wissy.

257
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:02,150
SHE SCREAMS

258
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,200
Shut up!

259
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,300
No, he didn't.

260
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,080
You've literally been kissing all night.

261
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,480
Oh, I'm going to cry!

262
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,880
She's loving it!

263
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:11,580
SHE LAUGHS

264
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,440
It was Dave wasn't even thinking, just going like,

265
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,340
I'd give him a copy, give it straight to Eve.

266
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:17,570
LAUGHTER

267
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,740
At least I know now to give it to the one that hasn't got one.

268
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,220
Yeah.

269
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,800
Yeah, he's not going to live that down.

270
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,930
Giving the wrong coffees, are we?

271
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,260
Yeah!

272
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,460
Oh, you big man.

273
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,960
Do you know what, I actually feel, like, real good, do you know what I mean?

274
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,950
I have to come in this time and, as a bombshell, do what I need to do

275
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,860
and do like what's for my journey.

276
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,700
I think I need to chat to people

277
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,460
because like even just the energy you bring to the villa,

278
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,980
like if you shut yourself off from people,

279
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,080
you're not getting the full experience.

280
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,980
I think I'll definitely obviously grab people

281
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,820
and just chill and just see what the vibe is

282
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,800
and just get to know people.

283
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,680
Yeah, absolutely bro.

284
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,740
And I don't think you're doing anything wrong at that

285
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,280
by doing that as well.

286
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,030
Oh, I feel awkward.

287
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,120
You're like a little kid.

288
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,020
Oh God.

289
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,980
Go on then, let's start with you then.

290
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,980
Yeah, come on.

291
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,460
You okay?

292
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,700
Well, I feel like everything now makes sense.

293
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,840
I feel like, like...

294
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:19,960
LAUGHTER

295
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:20,970
It's taken four weeks.

296
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:21,970
Shut up.

297
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:22,970
Come on.

298
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,240
But I feel like, obviously, in here, I do feel like I've had, like, a mad journey, and

299
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:35,920
I feel like everyone that I've been coupled up with has not felt as, like, right as this.

300
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,280
Yeah.

301
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,460
And I feel like it's, like...

302
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,840
Got instincts, telling you.

303
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,260
Yeah.

304
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,760
I was last night with him.

305
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,930
I heard he's in the kissing corner.

306
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:42,930
I know.

307
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:43,920
I mean...

308
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,780
Smoochy, smoochy.

309
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,930
I feel like that was Anton and George.

310
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:47,930
I heard you in Kiss and Call the last time.

311
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:50,730
Yeah, I was going to say, Jesus Christ, literally all I heard...

312
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,450
******* I heard it, just eating each other's face.

313
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:55,770
Jesus Christ, have things stepped up a notch, then?

314
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:58,570
We get on like an awesome five and talk to her for ages, so...

315
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:00,250
That's good.

316
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:00,250
Yeah, that's good.

317
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,440
It's, erm...

318
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:03,450
Yeah, it's nice, actually.

319
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:03,450
I'm happy.

320
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:04,490
Yeah, good.

321
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,010
Are you interested in getting to know Adam?

322
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:08,970
I mean, like...

323
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,010
Obviously, I'm not, like, closed off, cos that would be weird,

324
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:14,290
like, after, like, a year and a half.

325
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,280
like, after, like, this long, I don't think, um...

326
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,730
Like, initially, I don't think I would be, like,

327
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,440
I really want to get to know him, but I'm still open.

328
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,920
Do you think anyone else in here would be as tight?

329
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,020
You never know.

330
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,650
Only time's going to tell, really, innit?

331
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,650
I feel like today he's probably going to have a chat

332
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,680
with a few of the girls, for sure.

333
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:35,880
He's a bombshell.

334
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,040
He has no allowance to anybody.

335
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,400
If you want to chat to more than one girl,

336
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,090
you're fully entitled to do it.

337
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,560
Grab the ball by the horns.

338
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,200
Yeah, exactly.

339
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,060
Exactly, exactly.

340
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:45,800
For sure.

341
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,520
Chris is gone, but he promised that when he got out, he'd give Toby a ring.

342
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,480
You could have given her a ring before you left, Chris.

343
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,240
Your bloody fingers were covered in them.

344
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,340
Jay, how do you think Toby's feeling today?

345
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,840
I mean, I definitely think he's a bit down, like, it's a bit rubbish.

346
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,160
He's lost his best friend in here.

347
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,000
I'll help you cheer him up if you want.

348
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:10,480
Yeah.

349
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,680
I think I might go and do him bagels.

350
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,560
What, should we get a little bit cheffy?

351
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:15,660
Shall we?

352
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,120
What, should the G's get cheffy?

353
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,800
Can I make Anton one as well?

354
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,260
Yeah.

355
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,560
So obviously, Chris has just left the villa.

356
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,160
That was Toby's best friend.

357
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,000
And last night, Toby really, really took it hard.

358
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,260
So we have decided that we are going to make

359
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,360
our men a special breakfast.

360
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,920
Look at me and you cheffing up, G.

361
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:33,620
I know.

362
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,600
We're like housewives.

363
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,960
Where's the pepper?

364
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,540
Oh, there.

365
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,720
Tobe definitely needs support at the moment.

366
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,240
And if anyone's going to give it to me, it'll be Anton,

367
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,800
cos he's just such an understanding, caring little egg.

368
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:50,570
And I love an egg.

369
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,960
What we should do is I'll do a plate of bagels,

370
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,260
a plate of avocado.

371
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:54,770
Yeah.

372
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,540
Plate of egg.

373
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,040
Oh, you're thinking presentation.

374
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,500
And then they can pick what they want from it.

375
00:14:59,500 --> 00:14:59,720
Yeah.

376
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:03,800
Ready?

377
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,480
Yeah.

378
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,040
I think that's banging, that G.

379
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,210
I'm happy with that.

380
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:10,500
Yeah.

381
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,600
Shall we call them over?

382
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,090
Yeah, it's getting cold.

383
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,800
It's getting cold.

384
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,120
Boys!

385
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,800
Anton and Tobe.

386
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,320
Anton, what's his name again?

387
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:19,900
Yeah.

388
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,860
Georgia squared breakfast, can't believe it.

389
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,520
What is going on here?

390
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,520
Are they okay?

391
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,140
No way.

392
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,720
You guys have lost the plot.

393
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,320
Hi, guys.

394
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,120
What's going on?

395
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,560
We just fall since Chris has left the villa.

396
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,100
Yeah.

397
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,680
And obviously, Toby, you lost your best friend.

398
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,610
It would be nice if we could all bond as a family.

399
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,300
Yeah, I think it would be really nice.

400
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,000
Should we let the boys sit next to each other?

401
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:42,920
Should I go around there?

402
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,800
Yeah, we're one in a life now, bro.

403
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,020
Yeah, we're winning.

404
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,540
We're winning.

405
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,240
This is our first official double date, basically.

406
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:50,860
We're winning.

407
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,760
Oh my gosh.

408
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,660
We've put, this food wasn't just made normally.

409
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,060
It was made with love.

410
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,520
I don't even want to eat it because it looks so good.

411
00:15:59,600 --> 00:15:59,960
I know.

412
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,900
Oh, shut up.

413
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,660
It looks so good, I don't want to eat it.

414
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,180
Darling.

415
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,550
Oh, I don't know what to say.

416
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,840
Thank you so much, guys.

417
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,200
I don't know what to say.

418
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,040
It's all paid off.

419
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,020
So we say cheers to being happy in our couples,

420
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,720
falling for one another, and friendship.

421
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:19,720
Yes.

422
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:20,700
Chin chin.

423
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,180
Chin, guys.

424
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,040
I love yous.

425
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,040
I love yous all.

426
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,200
Jess, I'm grabbing you for it.

427
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,320
Wow, we really are matching.

428
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,660
I'm gonna speak to you as well, though.

429
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,320
What's going on?

430
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,600
Oh, life is good.

431
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,800
How long have you been in here now?

432
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,200
Last night was my fifth night, I think.

433
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,360
And how are you finding everything?

434
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,380
Coming in as a bombshell, it's difficult.

435
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:50,160
It is hard because everyone is very coupled.

436
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,180
So I'm coupled up with Callum at the moment,

437
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,260
and I'm really happy with how things are going,

438
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:59,120
but we are still in quite an early stage still.

439
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,540
I mean, you two were kissing and **** so.

440
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,200
Yeah, yeah.

441
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,480
At least you're on that level.

442
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,300
It's obviously moving in the right direction.

443
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,440
I mean, I'm right beside her.

444
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,260
I was like, first night trying to sleep, okay.

445
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,100
No, but it's, no, it's obviously,

446
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,760
It's moving in the right direction, which is good.

447
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,320
How do you feel about that?

448
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,040
You never know.

449
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,240
I don't know where Jess is at.

450
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,440
Have you not had a little chat with her about anything?

451
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,800
No, it's going well.

452
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,680
I know I feel like it's going well anyway.

453
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,920
She thinks it's going well.

454
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,240
Well, it looks like it's going well,

455
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,460
but obviously there's a fresh ******* kid on the block.

456
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:26,960
I know, mate.

457
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,040
Can't catch a break, can I?

458
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,480
You can't catch a break, can you?

459
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,980
And he's ******* tough, isn't he?

460
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,400
You came in with bombshell energy.

461
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,000
To be transparent, I picked Arabella

462
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,920
because I feel like her energy is good.

463
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,480
and we had a good chat last night,

464
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,280
but probably my mistake, I haven't said to her yet,

465
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,140
that I want to grab other people.

466
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,680
It's been early, so obviously it'd be weird for me

467
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,380
to be like I am in a closed-off couple.

468
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,600
But yeah, we'll just see how it goes.

469
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,200
Casey's been with Eve for three days now.

470
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,560
Well, technically two days.

471
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,380
One day, Eve was a bit under the weather,

472
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,140
so she got Jess to stand in for her.

473
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,020
All right, Shannon.

474
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,160
Come on.

475
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:02,920
You don't mush.

476
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,860
You both all right?

477
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,340
I'm good, man.

478
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,140
How are you?

479
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,220
Good.

480
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:08,940
How are you?

481
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,040
I'm all right.

482
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,080
I think you're just all right, aren't you?

483
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,160
Yeah, I just think it's been, what, now three, four days with Eve,

484
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,520
and, like, we have really been getting along,

485
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,720
and I think she's class,

486
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,440
and I genuinely don't have a bad word to say about her.

487
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,400
Yeah.

488
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,580
And if I'm being real with myself,

489
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:34,120
I don't think it is going maybe where I want it to go.

490
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,780
I just don't feel like I've found that spark.

491
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,060
It's tough to say, cos I guess I've just got to be real.

492
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,220
It takes a big man to do it, if he's just close.

493
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,780
I've just got to be real, and I don't want to get to the end of here

494
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,880
and end up in the outside with Eve and Lieder on.

495
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,600
And hurting her feelings.

496
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,760
I feel like there's something missing, maybe.

497
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,620
You should be honest with yourself, though.

498
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,920
I don't think it's been easy for anyone, has it?

499
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,220
Apart from Tom and Molly.

500
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,060
Cruising me!

501
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,820
I know, I'm jealous of Tom, I am.

502
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,180
I'm proper buzzing for you, but...

503
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,720
It would be so nice to actually have that experience

504
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,410
where you just absolutely fall for someone in here.

505
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,130
And I don't feel like I've had that

506
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,680
since I first came in the first time round.

507
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,760
If you are thinking about turning, don't leave it too long.

508
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,720
No, I wouldn't do that, cos...

509
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:28,160
..the more feelings they have, the harder it's going to get.

510
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:28,660
Yeah.

511
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,560
The journey for a girlfriend continues.

512
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,220
One day, mate.

513
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:34,720
One day.

514
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,610
Adam's chatting to Eve.

515
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:39,610
Now, I was talking to Eve earlier.

516
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:42,730
She asked me if I was from Norway or Cameroon.

517
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:44,770
Where are you, Scotland or Ireland?

518
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:47,490
Scotland.

519
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:47,490
That's an insult.

520
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:49,930
I'm sure of it.

521
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:49,930
No, Ireland, Ireland.

522
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:51,410
Well, fast.

523
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:53,930
Oh, do you know what?

524
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:53,930
It's actually very similar, to be fair.

525
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:55,810
Oh, he's took your girl.

526
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,050
Oh, they're kissing.

527
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,130
Oh, my God, he just smacked her ****.

528
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:01,610
Wow, she just told him she loves him.

529
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:03,570
Oh, that's so sweet of her.

530
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,530
Wow, she just told him she loves him.

531
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,400
You've got a good hearing.

532
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,210
Obviously, it's still early days for me and Casey.

533
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,610
I'm happy with him, I like him, but it's definitely too soon

534
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,650
to close things off and be like, you know,

535
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,610
we're not going to get to know other people.

536
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,250
I think people would look at me and go,

537
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,250
gym guy, like tattoos, maybe you are the *******.

538
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:23,430
Yeah.

539
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:23,850
Have you cheated on...?

540
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:23,850
Yeah.

541
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,340
Oh, After.

542
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,010
I know, I'm like...

543
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:27,900
Do you know what?

544
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,210
I'm really disappointed in myself.

545
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,050
Do you know what, I think when a guy cheats,

546
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:32,610
it is a lack of discipline.

547
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,280
lack of discipline.

548
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,480
Lack of discipline.

549
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,560
You're so switched on.

550
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,800
Yeah I feel like I'm really

551
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,480
emotionally intelligent that's just through the mistakes that I've made I'm

552
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,360
like trying to be better and take accountability and like grow up and be a

553
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,080
man and yeah I'm proud of like how I carry myself and hold myself but you

554
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,780
know I just I think I definitely get that stereotype and then people get to

555
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,420
know me they like oh you're actually more than what you yeah like like I'm

556
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,580
sure you as twins as well maybe get that like people judge you and think oh

557
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,340
Yeah, I've got everyone.

558
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,720
Oh, thank you, you've got a good body.

559
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,880
Well, it's all right.

560
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,680
Gym bod.

561
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,660
Yours is better than mine, but...

562
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:14,960
Oh!

563
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,340
I've got * ****!

564
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,960
Islanders, it's time to serve major looks,

565
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,820
As tonight, you'll be having a pre-loved pink party.

566
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:32,520
Hashtag pink to make everyone wink, hashtag eBay.

567
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,840
Look at all my friends!

568
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,660
Look at all my friends!

569
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,920
What's up, what's up?

570
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,090
Look at all my friends!

571
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,140
I'm actually so excited.

572
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:43,760
Pink party.

573
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,800
It's giving Barbie vibes.

574
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,520
Pink to make the boys wink, pink to make the boys...

575
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,360
Pink to make the boys wink, pink, pink, pink.

576
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,160
People say pink is my colour.

577
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,160
So, tonight, I will be busting out the look.

578
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,220
CHEERING

579
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,600
Shall we go and have a look at what we can wear?

580
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,220
Girls, shall we go and have a look?

581
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:09,920
Bye, Sam.

582
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,480
It's time for the all-stars pink party,

583
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,360
We were going to have a red party and a white party,

584
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,960
but someone mixed the clothes up in the hot wash.

585
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,940
Who's excited?

586
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:31,880
Yay!

587
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:32,740
Woo-hoo!

588
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,880
Either way, that power looks so good on you.

589
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,600
How's your first day been?

590
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,620
First day's been good.

591
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,600
Had some good chats.

592
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,800
First night, I'm like, I feel complete now, girls.

593
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,380
******* hell, you feel complete?

594
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,500
He got in here yesterday.

595
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,680
Ah!

596
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,420
Oh, yeah.

597
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,280
Beautiful from head to toe.

598
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,300
I'm ready to go.

599
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,420
You know, you know.

600
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,160
It's pink.

601
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,440
Welcome, Adam, to the villa.

602
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,260
Thank you, guys.

603
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,940
We're so excited to have you.

604
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,940
Can't wait for tonight.

605
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:17,920
Good vibes.

606
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,440
And looking pretty and pink.

607
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,320
Yay!

608
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,440
I texted a load of my mates and invited them to my pink party.

609
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,420
They all showed up in safety pins and ******* trousers.

610
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,800
Stupid autocorrect.

611
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:03,810
What are you staring at?

612
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:04,810
She strikes again.

613
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:05,810
You look banging tonight.

614
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:06,810
Thank you.

615
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:07,810
Very sexy.

616
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:08,810
Thank you.

617
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:09,810
Do you like the pink?

618
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:10,810
I do.

619
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:11,810
Come on then, talk to me.

620
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:12,810
I'm talking to you.

621
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:13,810
I'm talking to you.

622
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:14,810
I'm talking to you.

623
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:15,810
I'm talking to you.

624
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:16,810
I'm talking to you.

625
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:17,810
I'm talking to you.

626
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:18,810
I'm talking to you.

627
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:19,810
I'm talking to you.

628
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,740
I'm talking to you.

629
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,380
I'm just chillin'.

630
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,660
Might have brought you up here for a reason.

631
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,420
Oh, really?

632
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,160
Do you know the tariffs of the...

633
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,980
It seems like a lot of, like, stuff going on up here.

634
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,760
I feel like we had a good day today, though, as well.

635
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,600
Yeah, I feel like it was a nice first day.

636
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,500
I just wanted to give you some space.

637
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,300
Also, I wanted to give you time to, like, chat to other people, as well.

638
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,280
I feel like that was what you needed to do.

639
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,400
But I think, like, I just gravitate back towards, like,

640
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,480
Wanting to spend time with you and talking to you.

641
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,880
It's just effortless, again.

642
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,880
Yeah, it does feel very effortless, for sure.

643
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,840
Just your eyes?

644
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,120
Three biggest turn-ons, what would they be?

645
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,340
Confidence, but not arrogance.

646
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,560
There's a fine line.

647
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,080
Tick.

648
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,600
You're very confident.

649
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,900
Someone that's emotionally intelligent.

650
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,860
It can come with age, but not always.

651
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,060
It's getting hot up here.

652
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,740
Emotionally intelligent.

653
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,000
And what's my third one?

654
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:20,610
She must.

655
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:26,610
Hey.

656
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,900
She's got him.

657
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,240
She has got him.

658
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,880
Well, that was my best terrace kiss, I can give you that.

659
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:51,520
You reckon?

660
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:51,960
Yeah.

661
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,920
Just see how cheeky, Faye.

662
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,120
Isn't it cheeky?

663
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,320
I didn't think my smile could get bigger, but clearly it can.

664
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,400
You're doing amazing, sweetie!

665
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,000
This is the most pink I've seen on display at a party

666
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,600
since my mate Scotty fell asleep in the sun

667
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,660
at East Agda in Fort of Ventura.

668
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,560
Take a seat, take a seat.

669
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,200
Oh, yes.

670
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,400
How's life treating you?

671
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,960
Life's treating me good, can't complain.

672
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:23,940
You seem happy.

673
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,380
Very happy.

674
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,260
Very happy I am indeed.

675
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:28,960
Life's good.

676
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,880
You're close to Josh, what does he say to you?

677
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,660
He doesn't say much, he actually doesn't say that much.

678
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,600
Does he actually not?

679
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,200
Yeah, he does like you though.

680
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,900
You've tamed him.

681
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:39,960
I've tamed him?

682
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,720
You've tamed him, I think you have anyway.

683
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,840
I feel like he's wild still, but...

684
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,740
How are you doing with my best friend?

685
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,420
Yeah, I'm very happy.

686
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,460
I mean, obviously, you're closest to them both, aren't you?

687
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:51,920
Yeah.

688
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,160
So how are they both feeling with the situations?

689
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,220
No, she's, um...

690
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:56,760
Happy?

691
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,240
Yeah.

692
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:57,720
I'm glad.

693
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,760
It's funny how things work out, isn't it?

694
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,480
Yeah, it is crazy.

695
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,140
Yeah.

696
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:06,300
How do you think Eve feels about Keita, any...

697
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,780
Why, has he been stressing?

698
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,540
Maybe a little bit.

699
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,020
Why?

700
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,080
I don't, I like, I think, I don't know.

701
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,280
I think you should just check in just to see if Eve,

702
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,640
in case you're on the same page, I'd say.

703
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,320
Oh, is Casey not on the same page?

704
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,600
I think, I don't know.

705
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,040
I think he does like her, and he did say he likes her,

706
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,780
but I don't know.

707
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,480
I don't know.

708
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:31,420
He's just maybe a bit confused, maybe.

709
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,280
But, I mean.

710
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,700
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

711
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,660
You can't, let's start from the beginning.

712
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,240
So, what's Casey said to you?

713
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,060
He's, no, he's, so, he does, he does like Eve.

714
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:45,800
He does like her.

715
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,060
He's just wondering if, like, that could be a real thing.

716
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,340
I don't know, maybe something on the outside,

717
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,360
like real world stuff.

718
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,700
But I feel like he's gonna talk,

719
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,960
he'll think he's gonna speak to her anyway

720
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,000
and have a conversation with her,

721
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,380
but I'm just relaying to you as a friend,

722
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,200
just in case, like, you might,

723
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,040
because I didn't understand,

724
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,700
I don't know where he was at, like, I don't,

725
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,420
that would just-

726
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,560
Obviously, I need to speak to her first

727
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,080
if she's prepared.

728
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,620
Yeah, but, like, I feel like he will, um,

729
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,500
Casey told me today that his feelings towards Eve,

730
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,240
and maybe just, the spark hasn't come yet,

731
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,320
then fair enough.

732
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,040
And I know Casey wanted to speak to Eve.

733
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,040
I just told Sophie just to make sure,

734
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,080
just to look out for Eve

735
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,340
and make sure she's on the same page as Casey.

736
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,760
Sophie's pulled Eve for a chat

737
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,400
to tell her the news about Casey.

738
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,080
She's invited Jess along too,

739
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,860
just to make doubly sure she's talking to the right twin.

740
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,480
Just been informed something.

741
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,800
Which is just weird.

742
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,780
Bit of weird information.

743
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,480
Go on.

744
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:46,500
Basically, obviously, you know that I pressed the cowl in here.

745
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,100
Yeah.

746
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,180
He said that he was talking to Kasey.

747
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,200
Yeah.

748
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:53,570
And Kasey is basically, like, now saying, like,

749
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:57,380
he doesn't know if him and Eve could work in the outside.

750
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:58,760
What?

751
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,040
To me, he literally feels completely different.

752
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,720
I know.

753
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,560
And even the way he's been acting around you as well.

754
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,080
Yeah.

755
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,220
I know.

756
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,420
Like, he's literally, like, always there, like...

757
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:09,920
Well, that's that now.

758
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,900
I'm literally just going to be like...

759
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,020
You know what I mean?

760
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,170
Like, if he wants to be like that, like...

761
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,210
I just don't understand his, like...

762
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,930
..how his brain works.

763
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,770
Whatever happens, though, don't let Casey make you feel anything less.

764
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:24,920
Yeah.

765
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,320
Like, just remember, like...

766
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:27,800
You know what I mean?

767
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,530
I just think that's really...

768
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,020
I just think that's muggy as well.

769
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:31,460
Yeah.

770
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:32,600
Casey!

771
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,440
Where's that come from?

772
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:34,810
Oh, the balcony there.

773
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:35,840
Come up!

774
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,040
I've been summoned.

775
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,080
Please give him a good hold.

776
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,500
Please give him a cold stare on the stairs.

777
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,060
This is going to be like an awkward walk past.

778
00:29:59,480 --> 00:29:59,880
Yeah.

779
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,130
You come down first.

780
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:01,850
No, but he's up there.

781
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:02,800
No, you come up.

782
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:03,380
What?

783
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,400
You go up.

784
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,640
Yeah, I was thinking you come down first.

785
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:13,520
Hey.

786
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:13,530
You all right?

787
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:13,530
Yeah, I'm good.

788
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:15,760
What's up?

789
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:15,770
I've just heard, apparently,

790
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:17,570
you've been going to Callum, being like,

791
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:19,810
oh, yeah, I don't see a future with Eve.

792
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,010
I didn't say that.

793
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,010
That's a lie.

794
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:23,690
I just said...

795
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:23,690
What did you say, then?

796
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,290
Well, they just said, how's things been going with Eve?

797
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:28,090
And I said, yeah, really good.

798
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:28,090
Yeah.

799
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,130
Like, I'm just not sure if I see that spark yet.

800
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:33,650
Apparently, you said that you don't see a future with me.

801
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:34,970
I didn't say that.

802
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,450
Well, they said you did, but it's not like I'm sat here

803
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:39,490
thinking about, like, oh, yeah, like, the future,

804
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,010
about, like, oh, yeah, like, the future, like, me and you

805
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,400
going to get married and stuff.

806
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,920
I'm just enjoying my time here.

807
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,390
Yeah, and I've literally said that to them.

808
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,000
I feel like it's a bit muggy to be, like, like, imagine if I was

809
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,440
that old to the girls.

810
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,450
This has been taken way out of context.

811
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,940
No, no, no, but listen, I feel like you're just trying to, like,

812
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,700
put me down.

813
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,660
I think that's been taken way out of context.

814
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,800
I don't think it has, Casey.

815
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,170
I think it has.

816
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:58,860
It's come from something.

817
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,000
I'm just saying...

818
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,100
I was just being totally honest with them.

819
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:02,800
Yeah, OK.

820
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,830
It's not like I'm sat here...

821
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,520
It's really not, like, that deep.

822
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,920
Like, it's kind of deep to me, to be honest.

823
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,780
I feel like that just makes that...

824
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,280
Like, if I'm just being honest,

825
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,800
it just makes me want to fully retract.

826
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,240
OK, well, if you want to fully retract, that's fine.

827
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,480
I think instead of these villa whispers,

828
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,970
maybe you should have just gone straight up to Cal

829
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,170
and asked him what I said instead of...

830
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,760
No, I just wanted to come straight to you.

831
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,320
Yeah, but instead of Cal speaking to Sophie,

832
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,440
Sophie's speaking to you.

833
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,840
Should I ask Callum now, then?

834
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,160
Yeah, I'm happy for you two.

835
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:30,820
Callum?

836
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:31,840
Yeah?

837
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,960
Can you join us, please?

838
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:34,840
Oh!

839
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:36,540
Like...

840
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,460
Would you prefer me to go to Callum, or you?

841
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:39,980
I'm coming to you.

842
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,300
The boys have asked me how it's going,

843
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,020
and I've been very positive about it,

844
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,820
and I've said it's going really well,

845
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,720
but I just said I don't have that spark yet,

846
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,400
that's what I said.

847
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,740
I know what it is, Casey, I'm not stupid,

848
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,900
like now I just think.

849
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:55,100
But instead of these people saying this, saying that,

850
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,970
like it could have just been discussed between the two of us.

851
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:57,440
Hey, Callum, do you mind sitting down?

852
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,640
I'm sorry to drag you into this,

853
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,480
I just would like to clear things up.

854
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,460
I just feel like there's been whispers

855
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,480
going around the villa here,

856
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,920
and I don't think it's completely accurate, to be honest.

857
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:10,480
Okay, so did Casey say that he doesn't see a future with me?

858
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,220
No.

859
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,620
Well, that's what I heard.

860
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,180
Okay, well, you still said that it's not a spark.

861
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,960
No, I said the spark's not there yet.

862
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,440
Okay, I'm not having a go.

863
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,960
I'm trying to clarify what's been said.

864
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,680
So you don't think that we have a spark?

865
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:24,900
Did I say that?

866
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,960
I said it's not there yet.

867
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:26,940
It's not there yet?

868
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,020
Yeah, it's not there yet.

869
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,980
But that's not, doesn't mean it's not yet to come.

870
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,120
Sorry, Caleb, you don't have to be here now.

871
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,530
Sorry, I just didn't say the whole future thing and I'm glad you actually came.

872
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,680
I just said, yeah, just about on the outside, like...

873
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,680
Anyway, thank you.

874
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:49,340
Thanks.

875
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:54,760
Well, to be honest, Casey, I feel like that's, yeah, I've heard it now.

876
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,880
I'm sorry that we didn't have this conversation

877
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,240
with other people getting involved.

878
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,800
We don't have a spark, clearly.

879
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,400
So, from here, I feel like that's that.

880
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:10,120
I think I'm just not going to put effort into making something work,

881
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,680
but I just don't think we'll go anywhere.

882
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,360
OK.

883
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,180
Let's phone off.

884
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,740
Oh, yeah.

885
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,720
I'm going to stay here and go get...

886
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,500
All right, OK.

887
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:18,940
..what's happening to me.

888
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,480
Girls! Hello?

889
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:23,620
Yeah?

890
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,120
Can you come back up?

891
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:25,820
Yeah.

892
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,100
OK.

893
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:43,720
Hey, girls.

894
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,280
What's up?

895
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,140
I don't see what happened.

896
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,420
Girls, I just kind of...

897
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,600
We knew you would, but what did he say?

898
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,820
What did he say?

899
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,970
He just said some stuff about, like,

900
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:56,140
oh, I like Eve and stuff, but I don't know about Sparks there yet.

901
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:56,720
Yeah.

902
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,160
I just don't like that vibe.

903
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,300
Yeah, exactly.

904
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,760
So he's just made me retreat.

905
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,240
I was like, I just think we should

906
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,220
just stop things here, then.

907
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:03,980
And what did he say?

908
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,380
He was just like, all right.

909
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,120
Oh

910
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:23,360
Can all Islanders gather around the fire pit immediately

911
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,720
It's not happy Texas it

912
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:57,990
Can you hear me?

913
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:02,560
Can you hear me?

914
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,520
The All-Stars have gathered to hear some big news.

915
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:20,380
All-Stars, step into the fire, deep into the fire, not around the fire, directly into the

916
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:39,070
fire.

917
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,760
Islanders, the public have been voting for

918
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,880
their favourite couple.

919
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:46,960
As Arabella and Adam are the newest couple, they are not included

920
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,640
than the vote.

921
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,660
The couples with the fewest votes

922
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,000
are at risk of being dumped from the island tonight.

923
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:36,700
In no particular order, the free couples with the fewest votes and therefore vulnerable

924
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:39,290
are...

925
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:51,740
Sophie and Josh.

926
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,220
Eve and Casey.

927
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:10,700
Until we find our breath

928
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:17,280
Georgia, I can tell you, bae.

929
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,260
Until we find our breath

930
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,820
Until we find our breath

931
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:48,290
Can all vulnerable couples please stand in front of the fire pit?

932
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:16,220
But one thing sure is true, I do not belong to you.

933
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,750
I do not belong to you.

934
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,800
The couple with the fewest votes and therefore dumped

935
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,980
from the island is.

936
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:27,980
Oh, God.

937
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,060
Eve and Kesa.

938
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:41,980
And I don't know anything, not anymore.

939
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:51,200
But one thing sure is true, I do not belong to you.

940
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,540
I do not belong to you.

941
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,480
****.

942
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,550
I love you, bro.

943
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,540
I love you, bro.

944
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,550
******* top gazer.

945
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:14,070
I'm so tired of running, I'm sick of letting you down.

946
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:21,070
I'm so tired of running, I'm sick of letting you down.

947
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,170
I love you so much.

948
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:23,070
I don't want to say it's okay because you've gone saving.

949
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:24,070
Yeah.

950
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:25,070
I'm so tired of running, I'm sick of letting you down.

951
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:26,070
It's been a lonely road but it's all over now.

952
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:27,070
But everything happens for a reason, doesn't it?

953
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:28,070
Yeah.

954
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:29,070
It's just so hard because obviously we're like that.

955
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,060
Yeah.

956
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:36,640
I'm so tired of running, I'm sick of letting you down.

957
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:43,040
It's been a lonely road, but it's all over now.

958
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:47,060
But everything happens for a reason, doesn't it?

959
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:47,900
Yeah.

960
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,060
It's just so hard, because obviously, we're like that.

961
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,300
Like, we live together, we speak to each other every single day.

962
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:58,980
And I hear people talk about love just for something to say

963
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,220
Make sure you look after him now

964
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,220
Make sure you're with him if he looks a bit down

965
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,920
I think I'm just a bit good.

966
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,380
He hasn't actually met anyone

967
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:16,140
He deserves it like he's such a good lad

968
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,840
Yeah, that's never gonna show

969
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,750
Go on, quick!

970
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,030
It's just weird, like, when we won't be able to, like,

971
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:30,550
to know if each other are OK.

972
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,390
I feel like I've only just got Jess and Eve back, and, yeah,

973
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,750
just gutted, to be honest.

974
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,060

975

Today was a bit emotional for you, I feel like.

Yeah, I feel like if I think about my sister and Sophie,

990
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,070
I get upset, so I'm, like, thinking about them.

991
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,780
OK, just have a little moment.

992
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:39,060
Yeah.

993
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,300
I'll speak to Kasey first.

994
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:40,700
Yeah.

995
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,480
But, Kase, you...

996
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,060
What a journey you had!

997
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,060
A year later, back in the villa.

998
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,060
You had, obviously, a little bit of a moment with Georgia H.

999
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1000
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,720
Do you think that could have become something?

1001
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,740
I think I'm a firm believer of if it didn't work out the first time,

1002
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,580
it's not going to work out again, and I stand by that.

1003
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,220
You were living your best life in there.

1004
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,060
The twins came in and you were, like, love-struck eyes.

1005
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,900
You had to chat with both of them,

1006
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,940
got a kiss from both as well in the game.

1007
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:07,740
How was that?

1008
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,700
Yeah, it was great.

1009
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,680
I mean, I can't complain.

1010
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,660
Not many people can say they've kissed twins on the same night.

1011
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,420
Yeah, no.

1012
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:15,800
You and Jess obviously both liked Casey at the beginning

1013
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,180
and you ended up with him.

1014
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,940
And then, it just kind of stopped today.

1015
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,440
I thought it was going well, and, like,

1016
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,620
I really enjoy spending time with you,

1017
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,940
but I just didn't have that spark yet, and that was it.

1018
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,620
Yeah, and in hindsight, do you feel like

1019
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,220
maybe you should have picked somebody else?

1020
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,780
I'm still happy that I picked Casey,

1021
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,060
because I feel like I can't see myself

1022
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,460
with anyone else in there.

1023
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,420
So, yeah, I don't regret anything,

1024
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,940
but, yeah, I'm happy with how things have worked out, you know?

1025
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,920
And obviously, you had to hear from Sophie.

1026
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,020
how Casey felt.

1027
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,320
How did that feel?

1028
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,100
So I'm not, like, I'm not mad at you, like, going...

1029
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,400
I feel like our conversation could be...

1030
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,180
I don't know, I don't want you to think I'm mad

1031
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,980
that you went to Callum or I found out from someone else.

1032
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,740
I'm not even mad.

1033
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,240
No, I think that was all explained.

1034
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,680
Yeah, it was just having that conversation.

1035
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,060
OK, yeah.

1036
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,220
Like, it's fine.

1037
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:06,840
It's not...

1038
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,980
Like, that's not a thing to me, you know.

1039
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,540
And are you hoping for your sister and Callum

1040
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,640
to blossom and last forever?

1041
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,620
How do you see that relationship?

1042
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:19,620
You know what, I would have never expected it at all,

1043
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:21,380
but I feel like they're really getting along.

1044
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,640
Like, you can even see in there.

1045
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,220
Yeah, definitely.

1046
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:26,920
Like, they just talk and laugh, and I'm just like, wow.

1047
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:27,460
Yeah.

1048
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,100
Where did this come from?

1049
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,300
Yeah, it surprised me, but I think they're actually

1050
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:32,220
both really happy, like, in there together,

1051
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,440
and happy for them.

1052
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,460
All right, and what is next for you both?

1053
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,840
Where are you off to now, then, Kase?

1054
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,940
Back to square one, yeah.

1055
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:40,260
Trying to find a girlfriend still.

1056
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:42,120
Had Tom not been with Moni,

1057
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:44,240
do you think something could have happened between you two?

1058
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:44,840
Who knows?

1059
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:48,940
All I know now is that I'm super happy for Molly and Tom.

1060
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,700
Like, I'm rooting for them to win, so that's all that matters.

1061
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:53,320
And how about you, Eve?

1062
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:53,980
What's next?

1063
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,020
I'm just going to wait for Jess to be with me.

1064
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,040
Chill out.

1065
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:57,740
Come, babe.

1066
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:58,860
I know, yeah.

1067
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:02,320
Just relax, wait for her to come back and then see where we go after that.

1068
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,620
All right, well, it's been great to have you both back in the villa.

1069
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:08,380
You may not have found love, but I hope you had the best time.

1070
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,120
Thank you so much, guys.

1071
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,080
